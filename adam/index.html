            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Deana and I have enjoyed 18 years of grace-filled marriage. Libby
              is our soon-to-be 15-year-old daughter and is a theater-loving
              rising freshman at Opelika High. Caleb is our wrestling enthusiast
              son, who will be a seventh-grade percussionist in the OMS band.
              Deana has spent the past two years loving on toddlers at FBCO's
              Bright Beginnings, but she's now in the process of getting back
              into public education after a 15-year hiatus. We are all members
              of First Pres Opelika.

            <blockquote>
              "A personâ€™s steps are established by the LORD, and he takes
              pleasure in his way. Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed,
              because the LORD supports him with his hand. I have been young and
              now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his
              children begging for bread. He is always generous, always lending,
              and his children are a blessing."
