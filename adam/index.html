                  Deana and I have enjoyed 18 years of grace-filled marriage.
                  Libby is our soon-to-be 15-year-old daughter and is a
                  theater-loving rising freshman at Opelika High. Caleb is our
                  wrestling enthusiast son, who will be a seventh-grade
                  percussionist in the OMS band. Deana has spent the past two
                  years loving on toddlers at FBCO's Bright Beginnings, but
                  she's now in the process of getting back into public education
                  after a 15-year hiatus. We are all members of First Pres
                  Opelika.

              As it became clear that God was calling our family to Women's

              our understanding of how he chooses to provide.
