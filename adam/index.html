          <p>
            Deana and I have enjoyed 18 years of grace-filled marriage. Libby is
            our soon-to-be 15-year-old daughter and is a theater-loving rising
            freshman at Opelika High. Caleb is our wrestling enthusiast son, who
            will be a seventh-grade percussionist in the OMS band. Deana has
            spent the past two years loving on toddlers at FBCO's Bright
            Beginnings, but she's now in the process of getting back into public
            education after a 15-year hiatus. We are all members of First Pres
            Opelika.

              "A person’s steps are established by the LORD, and he takes
              pleasure in his way. Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed,
              because the LORD supports him with his hand. I have been young and

              children begging for bread. He is always generous, always lending,

              As it became clear that God was calling our family to Women's
              Hope, a funny thing happened: we began to see that this ministry
              position would force us to depend more fully on God and increase
              our understanding of how he chooses to provide.
